# DiabeticRetinopathyClassification

Diabetic retinopathy is a chronic progressive eye disease associated with a group of ocular problems as a complication of diabetes. This condition can cause severe vision loss or even blindness. Specialists analyze fundus images to diagnose the disease and provide specific treatments. The correct classification of fundus images depends on the specialistsâ€™ skill and experience, as well as on the quality of the images. The aim of this work is to use computer vision algorithms based on deep convolutional networks to develop a method for detecting diabetic retinopathy. The method will be tested on public datasets, and the implementation will be carried out in Python using specific libraries.


Based on the results obtained, a graphical user interface was developed to run the project. It allows the selection of one or more fundus images and subsequently performs the classification according to the severity level of the disease (0 - No DR, 1 - Mild, 2 - Moderate, 3 - Severe, 4 - Proliferative).

Three datasets from the Kaggle platform were analyzed, and an optimal set of results was obtained for each of them.
